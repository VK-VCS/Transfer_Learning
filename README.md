# Transfer Learning

## Problem statement
To predict whether a handwritten digit is -
   1. odd or even from the keras mnist dataset
   2. greater or less than 5

### Stage 1:
Create a ANN model to recognize the handwritten digits

### Stage 2:
Utilize the number recognition model and further train the model for odd or even prediction


#### Note:
Stage 1 is being created for demo purposes only, in the current problem statement we only refer to stage 2 as transfer learning part.
